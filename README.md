# clock.js

## Setting Up
* Grab files and node.js and open a shell at that folder.
* `npm install`
* Set your MongoDB URL as the environment variable `MONGODB_URL`
* `node clock.js`

On Windows, this can be simplified to the oneliner `npm install & set MONGODB_URL=<your URL> & node clock.js`.
It should be running on port 3000.
